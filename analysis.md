Wallet Credit Score Analysis
Overview
This analysis examines the distribution and characteristics of wallet credit scores generated from historical DeFi transaction data. The credit score ranges from 0 to 1000, where higher scores indicate more reliable and responsible usage of the protocol.

Score Distribution
The credit scores are grouped into three broad categories for analysis:

0–499 (Low Score): 3,466 wallets

500–749 (Medium Score): 26 wallets

750–1000 (High Score): 4 wallets

The majority of wallets fall into the low score range (0–499), indicating that most users exhibit conservative or limited transaction behaviors. Medium and high score wallets are significantly fewer but represent the most active and presumably trustworthy participants.

Feature Insights Across Score Groups
Total Transaction Count: Wallets with higher credit scores tend to have substantially more transactions, reflecting greater engagement with the protocol. The median transaction count rises steadily from the low to high score groups.

Active Days: The duration of wallet activity appears relatively constant across groups; however, the number of transactions per active day increases with score, suggesting higher transaction intensity among better-scoring wallets.

Transaction Types and Amounts: High-score wallets show higher volumes of deposits, borrows, and repayments, alongside more balanced borrow-to-repay ratios, implying responsible financial behavior.

Liquidation Events: Wallets with low credit scores show a marginally higher incidence of liquidations, consistent with riskier or unstable behavior.

Relationship Between Features and Credit Scores
Scatter plots of total transactions versus credit scores reveal a positive correlation, indicating that wallets with more extensive transaction histories tend to receive higher scores. Boxplots of transaction counts across score groups further emphasize this trend.

Model Predictions and Interpretability
The XGBoost regression model trained on engineered features achieved a strong performance with an R2 score of approximately 0.94, indicating accurate credit score predictions. Feature importance analysis highlighted transaction counts, amounts, and ratios as the most influential factors driving the model's decisions.

Conclusion
The credit scoring model successfully captures the transaction behavior patterns that differentiate reliable wallets from riskier ones. The skew toward lower scores in the dataset reflects the real-world scenario where most wallets have limited activity or exhibit conservative behaviors. This scoring framework provides a transparent and extensible approach to risk assessment in DeFi wallet interactions.
